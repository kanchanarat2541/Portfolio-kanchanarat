# 📡 SNR Prediction Using Environmental Sensor Data

This project predicts the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in a wireless communication system using machine learning models.  
The dataset includes multiple environmental and signal-related features collected from sensors.

## 🧾 Features Included
- **Air Temperature** (`T_a`)
- **Humidity** (`RH_a`)
- **Air Pressure** (`P_a`)
- **Frequency** (`f`)
- **Soil Humidity and Temperature** (`RH_s`, `T_s`)
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** – *Target variable*

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, catboost)
- Google Colab
- RMSE, Percentage of Variance (PoV) for model evaluation

## 📈 ML Models Used
- Linear Regression
- decision three
- Random Forest
- guardian boosting
- XGBoost
- CatBoost

## 🧠 Key Features
- End-to-end ML workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation
- Independent project: no team support
- Correlation analysis, feature engineering, and model comparison
- Best result: XGBoost with PoV ~73%
