# 📡 SNR Prediction Using Environmental Sensor Data

This project predicts Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in a wireless communication system using machine learning models. The data includes environmental sensor readings such as humidity, pressure, and soil information.

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, catboost)
- Google Colab
- RMSE, Percentage of Variance (PoV) for model evaluation

## 📈 ML Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- CatBoost

## 🧠 Key Features
- End-to-end ML workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation
- Independent project: no team support
- Correlation analysis, feature engineering, and model comparison
- Best result: XGBoost with PoV ~73%

## 📝 Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: ML notebook
- `images/`: Charts and graphs
- `data/`: (Optional) sample or dummy datasets
